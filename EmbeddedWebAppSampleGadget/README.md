# Cisco Finesse - Embedded Web App Sample Gadget
The embedded web app sample gadget displays a web page in an iframe within the gadget when the tab the gadget is on is visible. It is intended to serve as an example of placing an external web application in a Finesse gadget. There are special considerations that must be made when doing this as some web pages do not render correctly if they are loaded in the tab of Finesse that is not visible and/or need special handling when the user navigates away from that tab. This sample provides examples of how to deal with these issues in a safe way using the standard support afforded by the Finesse JavaScript library. There are also some web applications that do not allow the application to be loaded in an iframe. In those situations, this gadget will not work with that web application.

This sample gadget contains the following files:

	FinesseJavaScriptLibrary/
		readme.txt
	EmbeddedWebApp/
		EmbeddedWebApp.css
		EmbeddedWebApp.js
		EmbeddedWebApp.xml
	_readme.txt
	EmbeddedWebApp.pdf

Download the version of the sample gadget that matches the Finesse version. Starting Finesse 11.0(1), sample gadgets will be forward compatible until compatibility is broken. At that time, a new version of the sample gadget will be published with the starting Finesse version number in the filename.

## Requirements
1. The sample gadget and the Finesse JavaScript library requires a deployment that includes Cisco Finesse. If you do not have a system that includes Cisco Finesse, you can reserve a [DevNet sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#!sandbox) for developing your gadget.
1. The web application needs to be able to be loaded in an iframe.

## Usage
1. Read the document EmbeddedWebApp.pdf for an overview about this sample gadget as well as step-by-step instructions on how to build and upload your gadget.

## Additional Information
##### Finesse REST API
Documentation for the Finesse REST API can be found in the [Finesse Developer Guide](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#!rest-api-dev-guide).

##### Finesse JavaScript Library
Documentation for the Finesse JavaScript library can be found on [DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#!javascript-library) and is also located on the Finesse server at the following URL: http(s)://&lt;FQDN&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/desktop/assets/js/doc/index.html

- You can access the JavaScript library at the following URL (starting Finesse 10.6(1)): http(s)://&lt;FQDN&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/desktop/assets/js/finesse.js.

 If you have third-party gadgets, the third-party gadgets can access the JavaScript library at: /desktop/assets/js/finesse.js.

- You can access JQuery at the following URL (starting Finesse 10.6(1)): http(s)://&lt;FQDN&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/desktop/assets/js/jquery.min.js.

 If you have third-party gadgets, the third-party gadgets can access JQuery at: /desktop/assets/js/jquery.min.js.

**For proper functioning of the JavaScript library, you must import both the JavaScript library and JQuery.**

## Disclaimer
This gadget is only a sample and is **NOT guaranteed to be bug free and production quality**.

The sample gadgets are meant to:
- Illustrate how to use the Finesse REST and JavaScript APIs
- Serve as an example of the step by step process of building a gadget using the Finesse JavaScript Library
- Provided as a guide for a developer to see how to initialize a gadget and set up handlers for user and dialog updates.

## Support Notice
[Support](https://developer.cisco.com/site/support) for the JavaScript library is provided on a "best effort" basis via DevNet. Like any custom deployment, it is the responsibility of the partner and/or customer to ensure that the customization works correctly and this includes ensuring that the Cisco Finesse JavaScript is properly integrated into 3rd party applications. Cisco reserves the right to make changes to the JavaScript code and corresponding API as part of the normal Cisco Finesse release cycle.

It is Cisco's intention to ensure JavaScript compatibility across versions as much as possible and Cisco will make every effort to clearly document any differences in the JavaScript across versions in the event that a backwards compatibility impacting change is made.
